          <p class="flow-text">I chose to implement server side pagination, because I
            wanted to include best practices for larger scale projects</p>
          <p class="flow-text">I know full well that it would've been easier to do a full
            subscription (query = {}) and then perform the sorting on the client. That would've been
            fine for a small project like this, too. With small datasets, this is the correct decision.</p>
          <p class="flow-text">When you get into handling large amounts of data, you have to more
            creative</p>
